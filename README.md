# Artistica-An-Event-Management-Website-for-Performing-Artists
The key purpose of the project is to initiate a common platform of job undertakings and recruitments for performing artists. This project intends to be put forth in the form of a job-related website. A website where event managers can post the performing jobs and hire the required artists for the events and the performing artists can undertake those jobs.
